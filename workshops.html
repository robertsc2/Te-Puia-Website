               <b>Carving School – Te Wānanga Whakairo</b><br> <br>
               In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving School began the
               task of learning the disciplines of their Māori ancestors. Among
               those students was Clive Fugill, the man who would become master
               carver of the institute today.<br><br>
               “I’ll never forget that first day,” says Clive, “Our master carver,
               Hone Taiapa, looked at us all and said, “you are here to learn the
               art to pass it on to generations. Keep it alive for we could lose
               our identity.” It was exciting to be playing such an important role
               to save Māori art,” says Clive, “everyone has a reason in life. This
               was my reason. And that’s why I’m still here over 40 years later.
               If we lose our arts and crafts we lose our identity.”<br><br>
               Today fulltime carving students study for three years at the
               national carving school, under the guidance of those, such as Clive
               Fugill and James Rickard, master carvers at Te Puia who were once
               institute carving students themselves.<br><br>
               The protruding tongue, as used in the haka (war dance), is intended
               as a symbol of defiance, determination and strength, however in many
               carvings it can also symbolize the oral nature in which information
               was passed on from generation to generation.<br><br>
               Here at Te Puia we offer you the chance to take away traditional
               Māori carvings; beautiful handcrafted pieces made at our National
               Carving School. Look for the Te Puia Official Mark of Authenticity.
               We also accept carving commissions.

               Harakeke (Flax) is unique to New Zealand and is one of our most
               ancient plant species. <br><br>
               When our ancestors arrived to New Zealand they quickly discovered
               that flax could be woven to make clothing, housing materials and
               decorative tūrapa (panels) for their houses.<br><br>
               Two native species of flax both come from the lily family.<br>
               Harakeke (common flax) grows up to three meters high and has firm,
               long leaves with a fine muka fibre, ideal for all types of weaving.
               Wharariki (mountain flax) is found along coast lines, growing up to
               1.6 meters with softer leaves and less fibre than harakeke.
               <br><br>
               At the National Weaving school, students are taught the skills and
               traditions of a craft hundreds of years old.<br> “I believe weaving
               can only be learnt the old way - by sitting, by listening, by
               touching and by doing,” says head of the weaving school, Edna
               Pahewa.
               <br><br>
               As well as learning how to weave harakeke (flax) and other materials
               , students learn the stories and designs unique to each iwi (tribe),
               as well as the Māori protocols associated with weaving. These
               include planting according to the phases of the moon and reciting
               prayers of thanks for flax and trees used. <br><br>
               Te Rito is named after the baby shoot that sits deep at the heart of
               the flax. That baby is protected by two outside shoots, the mother
               and father. Students learn never to touch the inner three shoots
               when cutting the flax as they are the nucleus - the family unit too
               precious to be broken. Without these shoots, the flax will lose its
               identity.

               <b>Wooden Hand Clubs</b><br> <br>
               Before Europeans and European weapons arrived in Aotearoa, Māori
               warfare mainly involved hand-to-hand combat. Warriors used many
               different hand weapons, including taiaha (fighting staffs),
               pouwhenua (pointed staffs), tewhatewha (axe-like staffs), tao
               (short spears), huata (long spears) and patu (clubs).<br>
               The long weapons were carried, and the small clubs were often
               tucked into a belt. Special weapons were sometimes given names
               and passed down through generations.<br> <br>
               Wars could be fought over land and resources, but also as utu
               (revenge) or to increase mana (prestige).<br>There were many
               traditions and rules to be followed during battles in earlier
               times. <br> War parties (taua) could range in size from a small
               group to a few hundred people. <br> <br> Most battles took
               place in the summer months after the harvesting of crops was
               completed. The element of surprise was important, so raids often
               happened at dawn.<br> <br>
               Though there were deaths and injuries as a result of skirmishes
               in pre-European times, the numbers were very small in comparison
               to the slaughter that occurred when muskets became available.
