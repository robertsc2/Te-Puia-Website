            Harakeke (Flax) is unique to New Zealand and is one of our most 
            ancient plant species. </br></br>
            When our ancestors arrived to New Zealand they quickly discovered 
            that flax could be woven to make clothing, housing materials and 
            decorative tūrapa (panels) for their houses.</br></br>
            Two native species of flax both come from the lily family.</br> 
            Harakeke (common flax) grows up to three meters high and has firm, long 
            leaves with a fine muka fibre, ideal for all types of weaving. 
            Wharariki (mountain flax) is found along coast lines, growing up to 
            1.6 meters with softer leaves and less fibre than harakeke.
            At the National Weaving school, students are taught the skills and 
            traditions of a craft hundreds of years old. “I believe weaving can 
            only be learnt the old way - by sitting, by listening, by touching 
            and by doing,” says head of the weaving school, Edna Pahewa.
            As well as learning how to weave harakeke (flax) and other materials
            , students learn the stories and designs unique to each iwi (tribe), 
            as well as the Māori protocols associated with weaving. These 
            include planting according to the phases of the moon and reciting 
            prayers of thanks for flax and trees used.
            Te Rito is named after the baby shoot that sits deep at the heart of
            the flax. That baby is protected by two outside shoots, the mother 
            and father. Students learn never to touch the inner three shoots 
            when cutting the flax as they are the nucleus - the family unit too
            precious to be broken. Without these shoots, the flax will lose its 
            identity.
